### Sandbox

This is designed to be an app to document my progress as a developer. As I learn new things, develop, and build I hope to share and explore them here.

This repository is the front-end client, written in React, Redux & TypeScript. This is probably a little overkill for a simple blog, but I enjoy working with the technologies and hope to expand it to be able to do many more things in the future.
